# CS465-FullStack

# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

There were several different types of frontend development that I used in my full stack project. Express HTML was used to set up and deploy a local web server. Javascript was used to create the frontend webpage and control its behavior. The single-page application (SPA) was used to load just one website that could be updated to have the content of multiple websites through swapping out its components. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because NoSQL databases are scalable and can enable quick updates to data fields. These functionalities are useful when user trip information is being edited.

# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is different from Javascript because it can store Javascript objects as text, making it easy for Javascript objects to be sent between computers and used without worrying about programming language compatibility.
JSON ties together the frontend and backend development pieces because it enables Javascript objects to be displayed on the client-side and converted into text to be stored in a database on the backend. 
One instance in the full stack process when I refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies was for when I had redone the main page to enable functionality for a single page application. One of the benefits that came from a reusable user interface (UI) component such as a single page application was decreased loading times, as instead of loading entire pages at once the program instead only loaded segments of pages depending on the user's actions. This made loading websites much faster for the user.  

# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Methods are used in a full stack application to enable the website to perform different functions. For example, in my project there was a function called editTrip that, when the user clicked on the Edit Trip button, took the user to a screen where they could modify the details of their selected trip.
Endpoints were used to set up a connection between the server computer the website was hosted on and the client's computer. This enables the user to connect to the website and enter information into it.
Security was a major priority, to ensure that the credentials the user entered in to access their website were protected and could not be stolen by hackers exploiting an insecure connection. 

# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has helped me in reaching my professional goals by giving me practice and experience with full-stack development. I can use the program that I have developed in this class to display my skills in full-stack development to impress employers and show that I am a qualified candidate. 
I have learned and developed many skills in this class that help me become a more marketable candidate. In particular, I have learned how to use the many different types of frameworks and software that are involved with full-stack development.
